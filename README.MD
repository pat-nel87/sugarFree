# Sugar_free
## a diabetes management app in django
 A solo project I created to learn about django and python while 
 having a worthwhile goal. I've accomplished my initial proof of concept 
 and will continue to tweak/ upgrade as I learn new things!

Sugar_free aims to provide a simple user friendly experience
to record blood sugar levels, insulin doses, and macronutrient intake.
This data can then be displayed in various graphs defined by users requested
parameters.  
	At present, this is a personal pet project to further develop 
my python and django knowledge.
