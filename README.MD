# Sugar_free
## a diabetes focused personal analytics tracker

Sugar_free aims to provide a simple user friendly experience
to record blood sugar levels, insulin doses, and macronutrient intake.
This data can then be displayed in various graphs defined by users requested
parameters.  
	At present, this is a personal pet project to further develop 
my python and django knowledge. I intend to bring this from conceptual 
to functional over the next few weeks.

### Features to develop! 
- ~~Login / user registration~~
- rendering user analytics in user defined graphs
